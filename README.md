# kerr-geometry
Still in developpement, but a cool Kerr Metric plotter with Riemann and Ricci Tensor solver (nedd to improve and get a real Partial differentiation solver)

# Plot

The plot only use the kerr metric atm. This metric decribe a rotating Black Hole that depend of cinetic moment :

```math
a = J/ m^2
```
this metric took this form :

```math
G_{\mu \nu}dx^\mu dx^\nu=-(1-{2GMr\over c^2p^2})c^2dt^2-{4GMac\sin^2\theta\over c^2p^2}cdtd\phi+{p^2\over\Delta}dr^2+p^2d\theta^2+(r^2+a^2+{2GMa^2r\sin^2\theta\over c^2p^2})\sin^2\theta d\phi^2
```
